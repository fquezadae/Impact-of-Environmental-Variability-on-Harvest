# Introduction

The distribution and abundance of marine resources are changing in response to environmental conditions such as global ocean warming [@Poloczanska2013-qq]. Due to climate change, species distribution is expected to change in the future, reducing species availability in some areas but increasing in others. The literature that studies fishermen' responses to either changes in fish availability or policies that restrict access to fisheries [e.g., @Stafford2018-pq; @Vasquez_Caballero2023-ip] has identified that fishers can adopt the following adaptive strategies: (i) fishermen can reduce or reallocate fishing effort, either to another species or to another location [@Gonzalez-Mon2021-kj], (ii) keep following the same strategy, or, (iii) in the worst-case scenario, stop fishing entirely and find alternative employment elsewhere [@Powell2022-wj]. Among all those strategies, reallocating fishing efforts to other alternative species might be an effective adaptation strategy to climate change [@Young2018-kk]. Diversification of target species has been associated with reducing income variability [e.g., @Kasperski2013-jz; @Sethi2014-bn] and increasing resilience to both climate shock [@Cline2017-dp; @Fisher2021-lw] and interannual oceanographic variability [@Aguilera2015-wo; @Finkbeiner2015-bs].

However, switching between species requires fishers to have the skills, the gear, and the permits to do so [@Frawley2021-cw; @Powell2022-wj]. Moreover, even though a fisher may satisfy these requirements, diversification might not be possible [@Beaudreau2019-xg] as it might be constrained depending on port infrastructure, markets, and regulations [@Kasperski2013-jz; @Powell2022-wj]. Therefore, deciding which adaptation strategy to take is not straightforward and would depend on many factors. Additionally, fishers might respond differently to an analogous situation as they have different goals, skills, and preferences [@Zhang2011-wv; @Jardine2020-um; @Powell2022-wj].
