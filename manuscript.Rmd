# Introduction

- Marine resource distribution is changing due to climate variability [@Poloczanska2013-qq].
- Fishers respond to change by:
  - Reallocating effort to other species/areas [@Gonzalez-Mon2021-kj]
  - Maintaining the current strategy
  - Exiting the fishery [@Powell2022-wj]
- Diversification improves income stability and climate resilience [@Kasperski2013-jz; @Finkbeiner2015-bs]

---

# Why a Multi-Species Model?

- Responses to availability vary by:
  - Port infrastructure
  - Market access
  - Regulations [@Powell2022-wj]
- Different fishers, different choices [@Jardine2020-um]

---

# Case Study: Chile’s Small Pelagic Fishery (SPF)

- Anchoveta, Jack mackerel, Sardine
- ~94% of national catch [@SUBPESCA2020]
- Climate change will impact:
  - Catch levels
  - Prices
  - Species composition

---

# Research Questions

- How will **fishing decisions, catch levels, and prices** evolve under different climate scenarios?
- How do fishers **substitute between species**?

---

# Hypotheses

- Reduced availability → Switch if expected revenue > expected cost
- Otherwise → Decrease effort or exit
- Behavior is **heterogeneous**:
  - Geography
  - Gear type [@Reimer2017-jw]

---

# Methodology Overview

**Based on @Kasperski2015-jm:**

1. Estimate stock dynamics
2. Estimate trip-level costs
3. Estimate annual trips
4. Estimate inverse demand
5. Simulate climate change effects on profits/harvest

# Data Sources

## Requested (2012–2024)

- Stock abundance, landings
- Trip-level data (IFOP)
- Ex-vessel prices

## To Be Requested

- Sea surface temperature
- Chlorophyll, wind, wave
- Crew wages, fuel prices

# Model 1: Stock Dynamics

`\[
x_{i,y+1} + h_{iy} = (1 + r_i)x_{iy} + \eta_i x_{iy}^2 + \sum_{j \neq i} \alpha_{ij} x_{iy} x_{jy}
\]`

- Follows logistic + interspecies interaction
- Seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR)

---

# Model with Environment

`\[
x_{i,y+1} + h_{iy} = (1 + r_i)x_{iy} + \eta_i x_{iy}^2 + \sum_{j \neq i} \alpha_{ij} x_{iy} x_{jy} + \rho_i Env_{iy} + \varepsilon_{iy}
\]`

- Adds environmental covariates (SST, chlorophyll)

---

# Expected Results

- Climate affects:
  - **Stock** dynamics
  - **Fishing costs**
  - **Trip frequency**
- Catch composition shifts with climate
- Localized market effects

---

# Relevance

- Understand fishers’ adaptive capacity
- Inform climate-resilient fisheries policies in Chile
- Contribute to the sparse local multi-species economic modeling literature [^1]
