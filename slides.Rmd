# Introduction

- Marine resource distribution is changing due to climate variability `r Citep(bib, "Poloczanska2013-qq", .opts = citeopt)`.
- Fishers respond to change by:
  - Reallocating effort to other species/areas `r Citep(bib, "Gonzalez-Mon2021-kj", .opts = citeopt)`
  - Maintaining the current strategy
  - Exiting the fishery `r Citep(bib, "Powell2022-wj", .opts = citeopt)`
  
---

# Why a Multi-Species Model?

- Diversification improves income stability and climate resilience `r Cite(bib, "Kasperski2013-jz", "Finkbeiner2015-bs", .opts = citeopt)`
- Responses to availability vary by:
  - Port infrastructure
  - Market access
  - Regulations `r Citep(bib, "Powell2022-wj", .opts = citeopt)`
- Different fishers, different choices `r Citep(bib, "Jardine2020-um", .opts = citeopt)`

---

# Case Study: Chile’s Small Pelagic Fishery (SPF)

- Anchoveta, Jack mackerel, Sardine
- ~94% of national catch `r Citep(bib, "SUBPESCA2020", .opts = citeopt)`
- Climate change will impact:
  - Catch levels
  - Prices
  - Species composition

---

# Research Questions

- How will **fishing decisions, catch levels, and prices** evolve under different climate scenarios?
- How do fishers **substitute between species**?

---

# Hypotheses

- Reduced availability → Switch if expected revenue > expected cost in other fishery
- Otherwise → Decrease effort or exit
- Behavior is **heterogeneous**:
  - Geography
  - Gear type `r Citep(bib, "Reimer2017-jw", .opts = citeopt)`

---

# Methodology Overview

**Based on `r Citet(bib, "Kasperski2015-jm", .opts = citeopt)`:**

1. Estimate stock dynamics
2. Estimate trip-level costs
3. Estimate annual trips
4. Estimate inverse demand
5. Simulate climate change effects on profits/harvest

---

# Data Sources

### Requested (2012–2024)

- Stock abundance
- Annual landings
- Trip-level data
- Ex-vessel prices

### To Be Requested/Retrieved

- Sea surface temperature (SST), Chlorophyll, wind (Mostly satellite data)
- Wave height and speed (Chilean navy?)
- Other variables about weather (e.g. number of days in a year with storm warning? -- Maybe use wind/wave speed and height?)
- Crew wages (maybe INE?) 
- Fuel prices
- Vessel permits (Maybe I can infer them from the data)

---

# Model 1: Stock Dynamics 

## Base model

`\begin{equation}
x_{i,y+1} + h_{iy} = \underbrace{(1 + r_i)x_{iy} + \eta_i x_{iy}^2}_{R_i(x_{iy})} + \underbrace{\sum_{j \neq i}^{n-1} a_{ij} x_{iy} x_{jy}}_{I_i(x_y)} \quad i=1,\ldots,n
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
`
- where: 
  - $x_{iy}$ is the fish stock by species $i=1,\ldots,n$ in year $y$, $n$ is the total number of species, 
  - $h_{iy}$ is the annual harvest of species $i$ on year $y$, 
  - $r_i$ is the intrinsic growth rate of the resource $i$,
  - $\eta_i$ is a density-dependent factor related to the carrying capacity, 
  - $\alpha_{ij}$ are the interaction parameters between species. 
- Follows logistic + interspecies interaction
- System of $n$ growth equations can be estimated simultaneously using SUR



---

# Model 1: Stock Dynamics 

## Model with the environment


Following `r Citep(bib, "Richter2018", .opts = citeopt)`: 

`
\begin{equation}
x_{i,y+1} + h_{iy} = \underbrace{(1 + r_i)x_{iy} + \eta_i x_{iy}^2}_{R_i(x_{iy})} + \underbrace{\sum_{j \neq i}^{n-1} a_{ij} x_{iy} x_{jy}}_{I_i(x_y)} + \rho_i Env_{iy} + \varepsilon_{iy} \quad i=1,\ldots,n
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}
`

- Adds environmental covariates (e.g., SST and chlorophyll)


---

# Model 2: Trip-Level Costs

## Base model

`\begin{equation}
C_{vg} = \sum_{i=1}^{2n+M+k} \alpha_{g, \mathbf{X}_i} \mathbf{X}_{ivg} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{2n+M+k} \sum_{j=1}^{2n+M+k} \alpha_{g, \mathbf{X}_i\mathbf{X}_j} \mathbf{X}_{ivg} \mathbf{X}_{jvg}
\label{eq3}
\end{equation}`

where: 
- $C_{vg}= w z_{vg}^*$ is the total cost incurred by vessel $v=1,\ldots,V_g$ conditional on gear used $g=1,\ldots,G$:
  - $z_{vg}^*$ is the optimal quantity of input used, (e.g., crew members, time spent at sea, distance travelled?)
  - $w$ is a $V_g \times M$ matrix of variable input prices, 
- $\mathbf{X}_{vg}=[w;h_{vg};x;Z_v]$ is a $V_g \times (2n+M+k)$ matrix, and $\mathbf{X}_{ivg}$ represents the *i*th column of the $\mathbf{X}_{vg}$:
  - $h_{vg}$ is an $V_g \times n$ matrix of harvest quantities and 
  - $x$ is an $V_g \times n$ matrix of given stock levels of the species of interest, and 
  - $Z_v$ is an $V_g \times k$ matrix of given vessel characteristics. 

---

# Model 2: Trip-Level Costs

## Model with the environment

To link this function to climate variability
- Include additional environmental variables $Env$ to $\mathbf{X}_{vg}$ 
  - e.g., wind intensity and wave conditions in each trip at the harvest location, upon data availability.
- Therefore, the augmented $X_{vg}$ matrix becomes $\mathbf{X}^{'}_{vg} = [w;h_{vg};x;Z_v;Env]$.
- The model can be estimated with **SUR**. 

---

# Model 3: Annual Participation

The number of trips a vessel will take in a given year for each gear type used is assumed to follow a Poison distribution
[@Kasperski2015-jm]: 
`\begin{equation}
Pr\left[T^{*}_{vgy} = t_v\right] = \frac{exp^{-exp(U^{'}_{vg}\beta_g)}exp(U^{'}_{vg}\beta_g)^{t_v}}{t_v !}
\label{eq5}
\end{equation}`
where 
- $U_{vg}=[p,w,h_{vg},\bar{q},Z_{vg}]$ is a $(3n+M+k+1)×V_g$ matrix of explanatory variables, 
- $\beta_g$ is a $(3n+M+k+1)\times1$ matrix of coefficients to be estimated, 
- $t_v$ is the number of trips taken by vessel $v$ using gear type $g$ in year $y$, and
- $\bar{q}$ is the annual quota level. 

Additionally, we can add the accumulation of "bad weather days?" as an explanatory variable to
incorporate weather conditions into this decision, thus: 
- $U_{vg}=[p,w,h_{vg},\bar{q},Z_{vg}, Env]$
- Other variables? e.g., state dependency?

---

# Model 4: Inverse Demand

The price of each species is modeled using an **inverse demand model** (assumes weak separability...). The price of a species $i$ in
year $y$ is the following:
`\begin{equation}
p_{iy} = \sum_j^n \gamma_j p_{j,y-1} + \gamma_{h_i} h_{iy} + \epsilon_{iy}, \quad i = 1,\ldots,n, \ j = 1,\ldots,n.
\label{eq6}
\end{equation}
`
- The system can be estimated using maximum likelihood. 
- Note that harvest may be endogenous (assume TAC is binding? Estimate a vector autoregressive (VAR) model `r Citep(bib, "juselius2006cointegrated", .opts = citeopt)` that allows for endogeneity?)
- Other variables? 
  - Substitute prices? 
  - Fishmeal prices? 
  - Other demand shifters?

---

# Integration and Simulation

Use models parameters to:
- Conduct numerical optimization for different climate scenarios
- Obtain the optimal **harvest** and **quota** conditional on climate scenario
- Evaluate **profits** and **species substitution**
- I need future projection for climate/environmental variables (?)


---

# Numerical optimization

## Vessel maximization problem

In each year, a vessel maximizes profits by choosing their optimal number of
trips $T_g$ and harvest levels per trip $h_{g\tau}$ given a gear type:
`
\begin{align}
\max_{h_{gt}, T_g} \quad \pi_{vgt} & = \sum_{\tau=t}^{T_g} \rho^\tau \left\{ P(h) h_{g\tau} - C_g(h_{g\tau} | w, x, Z, Env) \right\} \quad \tau = t,\ldots, T_g \nonumber \\
\textbf{s.t} \quad q_{g,t+1} & = \omega \ast \bar{q} - \sum_{t=1}^{t} h_{gt} \geq 0, \quad t = 1, \dots, T-1, \quad g = 1, \dots, G
\label{eq7}
\end{align}
`
- where:
  - $\rho$ is the intra-annual discount factor, 
  - $\omega$ is a vector of shares of $\bar{q}$, and 
  - $h_{lt}=0$ for all $l\neq g$.

---

# Numerical optimization

## Some considerations

- The vector of shares is obtained from historical data on harvest. 
- The optimal profit from the maximization problem is $\pi_{vgy}^* (p,w,x,Z,\bar{q},\omega, Env)$, 
  - $h_{vgty}^*$ is the optimal harvest per trip.
  - $T_{vgy}^*$ optimal total number of trips.
- Optimal quota level, per year and by species, is obtained by solving the social-planner optimization problem to maximize the net value
of the fishery
